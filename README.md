# MetaMine
MetaMine is a tool designed to make metagenomics research much easier by solving a common problem: the scattered and time-consuming process of using many different databases and tools. Normally, researchers have to jump between platforms like IGM/M, JGI, HMP, MGnify, and NMPFamsDB for things like taxonomic information, gene details, and phylogenetic data. On top of that, they need separate tools like MetGeneMark for gene prediction, MG-Rast for analysis, GMGC for microbial genes, MetaPhlAn for species profiling, and MetaThermo for thermal stability.

This scattered workflow not only takes up a lot of time but also leads to repeated work, makes data harder to combine, and reduces the ability to easily reproduce results. MetaMine fixes this by bringing all these resources together in one easy-to-use web app, built with Streamlit.

With MetaMine, researchers no longer have to manage multiple tabs or figure out how to use different tools. They can search across databases, run analyses, and visualize results all in one place. For example, a clinical researcher studying gut microbes can quickly link taxonomic data from HMP with functional data from MGnify, while an environmental scientist can explore soil microbial diversity and thermal adaptations using GMGC and MetaThermo—all without leaving MetaMine.

By saving time and reducing technical hassle, MetaMine improves collaboration, reproducibility, and scalability. It’s useful across many fields, from clinical research to environmental monitoring, agriculture, and biotech. Simply put, MetaMine helps researchers spend less time searching and more time making discoveries about the microbial world
